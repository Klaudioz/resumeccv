#### Evolving the Itau Bank High Amounts System into an RPM packed product
<p align="justify">
Adaptation of Itau Bank high amounts system into a packed product (RPM). I developed 3 RPM, one for the backend (C transactional engine), one for the frontend (web portal using Java JSP and Servlets) and another one with the databases (Oracle/MySQL) with complex Makefile and difficult logic. My company sold the product to Santander Bank.
